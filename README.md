# File-converter
A simple file converter made using Win32 API. 
One of thermocouple loggers produced files with a lot of "trash" records, 
making it unreadable for other applications like Origin etc. 
A simple program was written, first as console application, for cleaning those files and creatig some readable records. 
Then i rewrite it as Win32 GUI application using Win32 API. 
It's very simple but it serves its purpose well.
